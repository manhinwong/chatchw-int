INSTRUCTIONS ON USING THE APP:
Upon Opening, you can click on the "Diagnosis Survey" Button to Start the Survey. Once there, for every question you must either click on a button or checkbox, enter a text input, or select a number using a number wheel before clicking "Next" to move on to the next question or instruction. For pages without these options (ie. The DiagnosisResult Page), you may continue without selecting an option. There's also a "Return to Home Button on the Top Right, along with Explanation pop-ups to provide more information on the exams, diagnoses and treatments. Keep in mind that all of the questions, inputs and outputs provided are currently hardcoded and do not change based on your responses.
